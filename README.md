# News Website Scraping using Selenium

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium, a Python library, to scrape headlines and text from a news website. In this example, we'll walk you through the steps to set up the environment and perform the scraping process.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- WebDriver (Chrome or Firefox)
- BeautifulSoup (optional, for data parsing)

You can install Python and Selenium using pip:

pip install selenium


## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-scraping.git


2. Install the required libraries:

pip install selenium


3. Download and install the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver for Firefox). Make sure to add the WebDriver executable to your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Open the `news_scraper.py` file.

2. Update the URL of the news website you want to scrape in the `url` variable.

3. Run the script:

python news_scraper.py


The script will use Selenium to automate the web browsing, retrieve headlines and article text, and save the data to a file.

## Customization

You can customize the scraping process by modifying the script. For example, you can:

- Implement additional data parsing using BeautifulSoup.
- Schedule the script to run periodically using a task scheduler or cron job.
- Store the scraped data in a database.

Feel free to tailor this project to your specific needs.
